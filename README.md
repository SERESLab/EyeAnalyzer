EyeAnalyzer
===========

EyeAnalyzer is a tool for measuring fixations in studies where the subject views several different stimuli over the course of the recorded session. It works by parsing XML data from an eye-tracking device and measuring fixations that fall within specified areas of interest (AOIs) over the time interval specified by for each stimulus. Screen-capture video is used for the user to specify the intervals and the AOIs for each interval.

Features:

* Click-and-drag drawing of AOIs
* Heatmap generation
* Fine-grained time specification for each stimulus segment
